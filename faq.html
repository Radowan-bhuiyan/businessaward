                                <h6>Q: How does this entire process work?</h6>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">  I was driving my truck that had my business name on it “XYZ Florist” and I honked at the car in front of me because he
                                    did not want to move his car even though it was already green. If my business applied for evaluation and the person, I
                                    honked at was one of your panelists, am I ever going to get approved or should I just give up?
                                Great example, but you have no reason to worry because of two reasons:</p>
                                <p class="text-padding1"><strong>1.</strong> If there was only one of our panelists’ sitting in that car, you can still win over four others. </p>
                                <p class="text-padding1">
                                <strong>2.</strong> Furthermore, when Tier 1 support gathers the information on the business and makes an initial assessment that gets</p>
                                <p class="padding-left1">
                                submitted to our panel of jurors, they will NOT see the exact name of the business, therefore their decision will remain</p>
                                <p class="padding-left1">
                                    unbiased and focused on the actual achievements and track record of your company.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h6>Q: Why aren’t you showing the names of the five panelists? What are you afraid of?</h6>
                                <p class="text-padding1">A: The reason why we don’t display the names of our panelists is simply that it is proven to be the best way to keep this process legitimate and to avoid any type of direct solicitation. By not knowing the exact panelist, no business will have the ability to meet any of them in person and try to use illegal or unethical ways to influences our panelists’ decisions (aka. freebies, discounts on services, trading favors). We have a zero-tolerance policy against that, period.</p>
